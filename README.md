WebGL Projects Collection
This repository contains a collection of six interactive WebGL projects that demonstrate various computer graphics techniques using WebGL. Each project focuses on a different aspect of 3D rendering and visualization.

Projects Overview
1. Alpha Blending
Folder: project-n-1-alpha-blending-giuliocapo
Description: This project demonstrates alpha blending, a technique used to render transparent or semi-transparent objects in WebGL. Alpha blending enables the blending of colors and transparency levels to achieve realistic effects for glass, water, and other translucent materials.
2. Transformations
Folder: project-n-2-transformations-giuliocapo
Description: Focused on geometric transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation in 3D space. This project helps illustrate how objects can be manipulated through matrices in WebGL, allowing users to move and shape objects in a scene interactively.
3. Triangular Meshes
Folder: project-n-3-triangular-meshes-giuliocapo
Description: This project deals with triangular meshes, the basic building blocks of 3D models in WebGL. It demonstrates how to construct complex surfaces by composing triangles and highlights the importance of mesh optimization in rendering performance.
4. Shading
Folder: project-n-4-shading-giuliocapo
Description: A project dedicated to different shading techniques like flat shading and Gouraud shading. This project demonstrates how lighting and normals interact to give objects a more realistic appearance in 3D scenes, showcasing both basic and advanced lighting models.
5. Ray Tracing
Folder: project-n-5-ray-tracing-giuliocapo
Description: A more advanced project that explores ray tracing, a technique for generating photorealistic images by tracing the path of light through pixels. This project demonstrates how WebGL can be used to simulate reflection, refraction, and shadows through ray tracing.
6. Animations
Folder: project-n-6-animations-giuliocapo
Description: This project focuses on implementing animations in WebGL. It shows how to smoothly animate objects in a scene by updating transformations over time, using keyframe animation techniques and interpolation for smooth transitions.
